## **Integration with Unreal Engine**

------

Go to the `Unreal Engine` tab in Wwise. If you don't see any projects click on :material-format-list-bulleted-square: button, select `Browse for project...` and find your Unreal Engine project.

**IF YOU GET AN ERROR LIKE THIS**

![image-20210426142558393](assets/wwise-integration-error.png)

Change Wwise version to **2017.10.6745.1113** and press `Integrate`.

![image-20210426142735360](assets/wwise-integration-button.png)

Now you will see Wwise downloading required files.

After downloads finished you should see `Operation completed successfully.` prompt.

By default Wwise project will be in the Unreal Project's root folder with a _WwiseProject prefix.

## Finding Sound Events

------

Use umodel to find the **sound** you want to replace. 

To identify sounds, open any of the .uasset files inside sound folder and their class statistics should say **AkAudioEvent**.  Ignore any file that have anything else suchh as AkAudioBank.



**Note name of the sound you are going to replace without .uasset prefix**

![image-20210426205257442](assets/umodel-akaudioevent.png)





From here on out we're going to refer these sounds as ***Sound Events***

Sounds are located at  **Plugins/Sound/Content**

## Importing Audio

------

By default Wwise should open with `Designer` layout. If not you can always change it by going to Layouts>Designer

![image-20210427014253271](assets/wwise-switch-to-soundbank.png)



Start by creating a new "Sound FX"

![image-20210426203903578](assets/soundfx-creation.png)

Right click on the newly created `Sound FX` and select `Import Audio Files...`, select your sounds on the opened pop-up.

After importing your sound, your Sound FX should turn from **red** to **blue**.


## Making Sliders Work With Your Replacements and Looping Your Sounds

------

On the  `Audio` tab and add three new "Audio Bus" below `Master Audio Bus`, call them `Effects`, `Music` and `Voice`

![image-20210426004217987](assets/wwise-master-mix.png)

Next, select the Sound FX, this should switch right panel to the `Sound Property Editor`, change output bus to the corresponding audio bus. **E.g. If it's a music set it's audio bus to Music.**



To make your sound loop, enable `Loop` option.

## Creating Events And Adding Sounds To Events.

------

Remember the names you noted down? Now we are going to create them again in Wwise. Go to the Events tab in Wwise and create a Event. 

**Name of this event should match the exact same name from umodel without .uasset prefix.**

![image-20210426211239062](assets/wwise-event-creation.png)



After creating your event, click on said event, this should switch to the ***Event Editor*** window (*highlighted in red*).

![image-20210426211841821](assets/wwise-event-editor.png)



Next go back to the audio tab (*highlighted in blue*) and drag-drop your Sound FX into the Event Editor(higlighted in red) window.

Your Event Editor should look like this.

## Creating Soundbank

------

Due to how Wwise works, your sounds are need to be in soundbanks in order for them to work with Unreal Engine.



Go to Layouts>Soundbank

![image-20210427014253271](assets/wwise-switch-to-soundbank.png)



In the new windows, press New and then name your bank file.

![image-20210427014423660](assets/wwise-soundbank-new.png)

After creating your SoundBank, select it. Your Sound Events should be on the left bottom panel (*highlighted in blue*), **drag and drop the Sound Event to the box highlighted in red.** This will add your Sound Event into the SoundBank.
