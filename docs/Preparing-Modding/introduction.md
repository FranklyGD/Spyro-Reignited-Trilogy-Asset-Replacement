## First Step

Before modding Spyro Reignited Trilogy you need the following tools in order to explore in-game files and create modded files.

!!! note
	If you only want to replace **sounds,** you don't need **Unreal Engine 4**, instead refer to [Replacing Sounds](../Replacing-Files/Replacing-Sounds.md) page.

## Requirements
* [Spyro Reignited Trilogy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/996580/Spyro_Reignited_Trilogy/)

* [Unreal Engine 4.19.2](https://www.unrealengine.com/download)

* [Umodel Viewer/Explorer](https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel) - [Github](https://github.com/gildor2/UModel)



**Installing umodel and Unreal Engine 4.19.2 is a must to create mods.**

!!! Tip
	If you are having skeleton problems or incorrect bone weights, you can use an older version of [Umodel](https://github.com/gildor2/UEViewer/tree/4f9664b6ac14a403ea80a47e5ea31e85f97bb223) or [Noesis Model Viewer](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php)
