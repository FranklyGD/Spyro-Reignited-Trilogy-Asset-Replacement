A:Unreal Engine 4 have a function called Material Flags, these are used for optimization purposes, enable the correct option that your material uses. You can find more information in here: https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Rendering/Materials/MaterialProperties/index.html#usage Q:Reignited crashes after replacing some stuff with my own mods. A:This can be due to many issues, making sure your unreal engine version is 4.19.2 and if it's a model replacement making sure entire model is merged into one is a good start. Q:My model looks like a popsicle Make sure you renamed your skeleton to Armature with capital A before importing it to Unreal Editor. * Another important part is to check for bone scales in Blender and Unreal Editor. In Unreal Engine main bone scale needs to be 1 * * For some models you need to remove SKEL_ files in u4pak process. Q:My model is T-Posing in game A:Make sure skeleton and physics assets are named exactly like original ones you're going to replace. Q:Model resizes itself when playing animation A:Make sure model's skeleton is sized correctly, if your model looks huge in Unreal Editor page. Q:My replacement doesn't show up in the game A:Make sure you replicated game structure in Unreal Editor and in U4PAK . Q:My assets doesn't show up in cooked folder A:Make sure you saved them in the Unreal Editor first, if you see a star shape at the left bottom of the asset's thumbnail it means it's not saved yet and will not be cooked. Q:Deleting and empty folder in Unreal prompts references window. A:Use Fixup Redirector From Editor . Q:Installed mod doesn't work. A: Make sure you're using ~mods folder to install your mods, placing mods in your Paks folder IS NOT RECOMMENDED and some mods ARE NOT GOING TO WORK . Q:My sound replacements don't play. A:Try changing Vorbis Quality to Low or Medium Q:Files doesn't show up in cooked folder A:Make sure your files are saved first(no * symbol on thumbnails)","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"Installing-Mods/Manual-Install/","text":"Manual Mod Installing Finding SRT Install Location Go to your Steam Library and right click on Spyro Reignited Trilogy Select Properties Browse Local Files Tab Click Browse Local Files...

Introduction: Now that you populated your map with lighting, fog, and static meshes it's time to spawn actors In this guide you're going to learn how to use blueprint system to spawn actors , You can use this guide to spawn not just NPCs but all kinds of actors as well. Problems: Pathfinding for npcs are completely broken, this means they can't walk or move around in your own levels unless you manually move them using blueprints. Some npcs doesn't work at all. Bosses either die in one hit or don't work at all. Some actors like water needs special setup in blueprints in order to work properly. Creating A Dummy Enemy Blueprint: Create a plugin for the actor you want to spawn . In my example I\u2019m going to spawn CES1016_Shepherd . You can use UE Viewer aka UModel to locate your folder and blueprint names. Replicate the folder structure on your Unreal project by creating a new plugin and Blueprints folder inside the newly created plugin Inside your Blueprints folder create an Actor Blueprint Class.

Using U4PAK Info All three of the u4pak linked below do the same process however user friendly u4pak can't extract pak files and is only aimed at creating paks, making whole process easier for mod creation. U4PAK Download Links: User friendly u4pak with folders already created Exe version of u4pak .bat / .cmd releases Python version of u4pak .cmd releases Installing: Extract u4pak to anywhere you like, extracted folder will be called Workspace from now on. Folder Replication Now that you know how to use u4pak, you need to replicate file structure of Reignited to replace in-game assets with the new ones you created. In order for your mod to work properly you need to replicate the exact file structure from UModel in your U4Pak folder. Reminder User Friendly version already have folders setup for main characters. Identifying a plugin Due to how Toys For Bob's internal structure works, plugins folder will have subfolders that are not plugins themselves . Due to this you need to find the correct folder that hosts the real plugin. Plugins are easily identified by the directory that contains a sub-folder named Content . Naming Your Assets You already should have correct asset named if you followed Replicating the Game Structure Unreal page. Just to be sure, make sure assets are named the same as the files found in umodel. Replicating Folder Structure In u4pak In your workspace folder(where u4pak is) create the same folder structure as you would see in umodel. After doing this you can place your files in their respective locations.

In order to do so, you must know how to use Umodel to browse in-game files. Identifying a plugin Due to how Toys For Bob's internal structure works, plugins folder will have subfolders that are not plugins themselves. Due to this you need to find the correct folder that hosts the real plugin using umodel . How to install and use umodel Plugins are easily identified by the directory that contains a sub-folder named Content . Creating the plugin in Unreal Engine In the Unreal Editor, you will need to create a plugin. To do so, go to Edit > Plugins. Click on \"New Plugin\". Select \"Content Only Plugin\". Name it exactly the same as how it was on Umodel . Example If the plugin folder in Umodel is called CPS1999_Spyro , name it exactly CPS1999_Spyro . After naming your plugin, press \"Create Plugin\". Making Your Plugin Visible In The Editor Now with your plugin created you need to enable the option to see it in the Content Browser Open View Options and Enable Show Plugin Content and enable Sources Panel to see grid view of plugins. Naming Your Assets When you create a new plugin, Unreal Editor will automatically generate Content folder that will not be visible in Unreal Editor . This mean you don't need to create a Content folder in Unreal Editor. Now go back to Umodel and check the name of the file you want to replace and where it is located at . You need to replicate the exact file name and location in order to replace in-game assets. Example Let's say you're going to replace Spyro's mesh: Your replacement meshes need to replicate folder and file structure of Reignited. In Umodel Spyro's mesh contains three assets. PH_CPS1999_Spyro.uasset , SK_CPS1999_Spyro.uasset , SKEL_CPS1999_Spyro.uasset located at CPS1999_Spyro/Content/Mesh Your own Spyro mesh needs to be at CPS1999_Spyro plugin, in the Mesh folder and names of all assets needs to be exact same as the ones in Umodel without .uasset . So if you see in the viewer SK_CPS1999_Spyro.uasset , name in the Unreal Engine Editor should be SK_CPS1999_Spyro In order for skeletal replacement mods to work properly, you must have skeleton(cyan colored) and physics(orange colored) assets right besides skeletal mesh asset(purple colored) in Unreal Editor. Again, make sure everything is named the same as the files found in Umodel Viewer and all of them are in the correct location and you have necessary files for skeletal meshes Now that you understand how to replicate file structure in Unreal you can continue with Replacing Assets tab or press one of the buttons below.

That page explains the correct import-export settings to use when importing a model to get the best results Static Meshes Basic objects in the game, such as rocks, buildings. There is no setup required for static meshes. Import to Unreal and replicate the file stucture in Unreal. By default, when you import a static mesh into Unreal Engine Editor, it would either come with materials set to default white or none at all (usually seen as a gray grid texture). You may add and setup these materials however you like to appear in the game. Skeletal Meshes As it's name implies, they are meshes for character or objects that can be animated. Skeletal Mesh Setup After you finished your modelling and imported the model/skeleton accordingly with the import-export settings. There are few things that need to be done in order to have error-free replacement. Make sure your armature name is Armature with capital A. After importing to Unreal follow Replicating Game Structure page to place your mesh into correct folder. Check the skeleton,physics asset and skeletal mesh names and locations are correct. (Replicating game structure) Click on the skeleton and check the root bone's scale, It needs to be 1. Having more separated meshes seems to cause fatal errors in the game, make sure you merge your meshes before exporting. Depending on the mesh, you will need to remove physics and skeleton assets in u4pak process. Character Requires Deletion In Paking Process Requires Replacing Of All Animations Spyro Yes No Sheila No but requires sockets to have attacks work correctly. No Elora No but skeleton import with umodel have bad bone locations. Use Elora Workspace for fixed bones. Yes Skeleton Replacement (Advanced, Untested) If you're planning on replacing the skeleton itself as well as the model follow the guidelines below to have crash and bug free replacement: Make sure bone names are exactly named like how they are in Reignited. Some bones are used by animation blueprints and if said bones cannot be found game will crash. Some models needs sockets to work correctly, for example Spyro's breath comes out from a socket attached to the head bone. Common Issues Root bone's scale being 100 in Unreal Engine: Open blender, scale both your mesh and skeleton 100 times Apply scales (ctrl+a) Scale model down to 0.01 Export without applying scale Tip If scale is 0.01 instead of 100, do the same steps but opposite scales.
