They can either be static mesh, or skeletal mesh. Static Meshes Static meshes are used by objects that don't move, like levels and its props, or do move but in a basic manner, like moving platforms, projectiles and rigidbodies (physics active objects). By default, when you add in a static mesh into Unreal Engine Editor, it would either come with materials set to default white or none at all (usually seen as a gray grid texture). You may add and setup these materials however you like to appear in the game. Skeletal Meshes Skeletal meshes are similar to static meshes until a certain point. Skeletal meshes come with skeletons bound to them that will deform them like skin in game. Skeletal Mesh Setup General skeletal mesh setup is no different than modelling an entirely new model however there are some steps you need to follow in order to have crash free modding experience First things first make sure your armature name is Armature mind the capital A. Having more than one mesh seems to cause fatal error crashes in the game, make sure you merge your meshes before exporting. Additive animations cannot be exported from Umodel and they need to be remade from scratch. Skeleton Replacement If you're planning on replacing the skeleton itself as well as the model follow the guidelines below to have crash and bug free replacement: Make sure bone names are exactly named like how they are in Reignited. Some bones are used by animation blueprints and if said bones cannot be found game will crash. Some models needs sockets to work correctly, for example Spyro's breath comes out from a socket attached to the head bone. Materials For Meshes Some materials are special that they have parameters which are modified at run-time or are usually not loaded by default and swapped in later by an in-game event.

Go to File > Cook Content For Windows. When that is done, head to this location: <Project>\\Saved\\Cooked\\WindowsNoEditor\\<Project-Name-Again>\\ Copy or cut out the folder and move it into a workspace. In your workspace, you need to recreate the file structure seen in the viewer, starting from Falcon. At this point you can choose between the two methods. Using u4pak Method (New, Faster) Download the u4pak.exe and u4pak.cmd files from releases of this repo and place it in your workspace folder. Simply run the u4pak.cmd and you should see the .pak files get created. Folder structure in u4pak should match the one in Reignited. If you already forgot refer back to replicating the game structure. Using UnrealPak Method (Old, Slower) Method below is not recommended and only here for archiving purposes. You need the UnrealPak.exe from the installed Unreal Engine. You can locate it in: <Epic Game Installed Folder>\\UE_4.19\\Engine\\Binaries\\Win64\\unrealpak.exe Make a copy of it and move it the same folder that Falcon is in, that is your workspace or \"lab\". You may need to make it three folders deep, meaning that it must be inside something like <workspace>\\v4\\2\\3\\UnrealPak.exe (It is better to copy this anyways because the .bat / .cmd we will be using later references this path). The only thing you need to do is to write out the resource's paths. In Windows, simple command would be: dir .\\Falcon /b/s /a:-d > assetlist.txt where assetlist.txt would be used to pack the files back. You still need to mimic the file paths found in the viewer by editing the generated text, replacing everything in each line before Falcon with ..\\..\\..\\ or using your favorite text editor by \"Find & Replace\" feature or equivalent (Regex enabled) - Find: ^(.*)Falcon - Replace: ..\\..\\..\\Falcon - Replace all Here is an example in VSCode: Run pack.cmd , a file pakchunk3-WindowsNoEditor.pak should be generated in the folder. If the size of the file shows to have 1 Kb, then it most likely didn't work and you must check your assetlist.txt and go over what went wrong.

You can locate it in: <Epic Game Installed Folder>\\UE_4.19\\Engine\\Binaries\\Win64\\unrealpak.exe Make a copy of it and move it the same folder that Falcon is in, that is your workspace or \"lab\". You may need to make it three folders deep, meaning that it must be inside something like <workspace>\\v4\\2\\3\\UnrealPak.exe (It is better to copy this anyways because the .bat / .cmd we will be using later references this path). The only thing you need to do is to write out the resource's paths. In Windows, simple command would be: dir .\\Falcon /b/s /a:-d > assetlist.txt where assetlist.txt would be used to pack the files back. You still need to mimic the file paths found in the viewer by editing the generated text, replacing everything in each line before Falcon with ..\\..\\..\\ or using your favorite text editor by \"Find & Replace\" feature or equivalent (Regex enabled) - Find: ^(.*)Falcon - Replace: ..\\..\\..\\Falcon - Replace all Here is an example in VSCode: Run pack.cmd , a file pakchunk3-WindowsNoEditor.pak should be generated in the folder. If the size of the file shows to have 1 Kb, then it most likely didn't work and you must check your assetlist.txt and go over what went wrong.
