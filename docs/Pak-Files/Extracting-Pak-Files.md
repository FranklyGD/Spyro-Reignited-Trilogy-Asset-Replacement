# Introduction:



Umodel can be used to extract meshes, textures and general material information.

Umodel cannot extract any of the sound files inside of a pak, however [QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/quickbms.zip)  and [Unreal Tournament 4 script](https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/unreal_tournament_4.bms)  can.

!!! tip
	You can find where Spyro Reignited Trilogy is installed by going into Steam Library>Right click Spyro Reignited Trilogy> Properties.. > Local Files > Browse Local Files...



## Extracting pak files:

* [Download QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/quickbms.zip) And [script needed for extracting the paks](https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/unreal_tournament_4.bms) 

* Extract both of them into the same folder. Location doesn't matter.

* Drag and drop **unreal_tournament_4.bms** to **quickbms_4gb_files.exe**

  * Select the .pak file you want to extract, they're located in **STEAM_INSTALL_LOCATION/steamapps/common/Spyro Reignited Trilogy/Falcon/Content/Paks**
  * Select the extract location.
  * Grab a coffee or take 15 minute nap because it is going to take a while.

  After the extraction you can refer to [common file locations](../Resources/Common-File-Locations.md) for finding the files you're looking for.
