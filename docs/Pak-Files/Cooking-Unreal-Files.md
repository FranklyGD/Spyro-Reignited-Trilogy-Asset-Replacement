# Cooking Your Assets 🍳



!!! warning
	If you're doing sound(wem editing method) or localization changes skip this step as they don't involve Unreal Engine 4.

!!! reminder
	Make sure you saved all your assets first! Unsaved assets will have * icon on their thumbnails.



Go to File > Cook Content For Windows.

!!! info
	Cooking for the first time will take a while depending on the amount of files you have, this is due to Unreal creating shaders and other build related files.

When cooking content is done, you can find your converted assets at:  
`<Project>/Saved/Cooked/WindowsNoEditor/<Project-Name-Again>/`

Follow the next step to create pak files with your newly created fils.
